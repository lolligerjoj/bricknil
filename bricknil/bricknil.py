    """ Class-decorator to attach peripherals onto a Hub

        Injects sub-classes of `Peripheral` as instance variables on a Hub
        such as the PoweredUp Hub, akin to "attaching" a physical sensor or
        motor onto the Hub.

        Before you attach a peripheral with sensing capabilities,
        you need to ensure your `Peripheral` sub-class has the matching
        call-back method 'peripheralname_change'.

        Examples::

            @attach(PeripheralType,
                    name="instance name",
                    port='port',
                    capabilities=[])

        Warnings:
            - No support for checking to make sure user put in correct parameters
            - Identifies capabilities that need a callback update handler based purely on
              checking if the capability name starts with the string "sense*"

            going into that __init__ call.

            Inside that wrapper, we do the following:

            # Instance the peripheral that was decorated with the saved **kwargs
            # Check that any `sense_*` capabiilities in the peripheral have an
              appropriate handler method in the hub class being decorated.
